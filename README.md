# Crosserville Toolkit

Provides additional tools for grid construction in Crosserville.

Upon clicking on the extension icon, a new 'Toolbox' tab is added to the Crosserville grid builder interface. A second click will remove the tab.


**\*\* Important: remember to save your work before using the extension tools, since undo functionality is not supported at this time. \*\***

## Current Tools:

- Flip grid horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
- Rotate grid 90 degrees clockwise or counter-clockwise.
- Flip contents of across or down slots.


## Installation

The extension is currently pending review, and will then be available on the Chrome Webstore.

You can also install it directly from this source, by following these steps:
- Click the green '<> Code' button, and choose 'Download ZIP' from the bottom of the 'Local' tab.
- Unzip the downloaded file. It should create a directory called 'crosserville-toolkit-main'.
- Open the extension manager in Chrome (by clicking the three dots in the top right > Extensions > Manage Extensions or by typing 'chrome://extensions/' into the navigation bar).
- Turn on developer mode using the switch on the top right.
- Click 'Load Unpacked' and select the 'crosserville-toolkit-main' folder.

You'll want to 'pin' the extension (in the extension manager) so the icon is visible.
